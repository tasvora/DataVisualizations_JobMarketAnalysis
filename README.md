Project 2 
The goal of this project is to study the job market of data analytics related roles. The data which will be 
used will be data scraped from Glassdoor and Indeed using the starter code the group created in the ETL 
project. We intend to show a time scale of prevalence of jobs in the data industry as well as densities of 
different targeted positions. The graphs will include maps, bar charts, as well as other visualizations 
related to the data.  
The data will at first be derived from the prior ETL project (https://github.com/taylorbreychak/ETL
Project).  
See the PDF for anticipated types of graphs and the dashboard for this project.
